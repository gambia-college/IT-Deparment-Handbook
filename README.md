# GC IT Deparment Handbook

**Everything you need to know about the IT Department**

Most of the time, we do not document what we do at work, for that reason, the IT Department didn’t have a handbook for the past years. When a new person joined us, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. And when the manager or someone leaves, the one replacing them has to start everything from zero because he/she will not know where to start. New employees felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it.

So, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about the IT Department, the way we work, the teams we have and our approach to work. What tools do we use? etc

Most of the time handbooks like this turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. In other words, they cover what people should do but in reality people don’t do that. Let’s not write a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest.
